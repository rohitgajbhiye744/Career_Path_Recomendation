Sure! Hereâ€™s how you can tackle **Step 1: Plan & Prioritize** for your Career Path Recommendation System project.

### **Step 1: Plan & Prioritize**

#### **1. Key Features (Minimum Viable Product - MVP)**

Given the one-day timeline, focus on these essential features:

- **User Registration**: The system needs to store user details (name, email, password) for the login process.
- **User Login**: Users should be able to authenticate themselves using their credentials.
- **Quiz**: Users will answer a set of questions to determine their career recommendation.
- **Career Recommendation**: Based on the quiz answers, users will receive a suggested career path.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admin should be able to view a list of users and their quiz results.

#### **2. Page Flow Overview**

- **Home Page**: Introduce the system, with buttons to navigate to **Login** or **Register** and a link to the **About Page**.
- **About Page**: Brief explanation of how the system works and the career recommendations.
- **Login Page**: Form where users can input their credentials (username/email, password) to log in.
- **Registration Page**: Form where new users can sign up by providing their details.
- **Quiz Page**: Simple quiz page with questions to determine career preferences or match.
- **Result Page**: Displays career recommendations based on quiz answers.
- **Admin Page**: A dashboard where an admin can see user data and quiz results (very basic for now).

#### **3. Tech Stack Decisions**

- **Backend**: 
   - Use **Spring Boot** for simplicity and quick development.
   - **Spring Security** for handling user authentication (Login and Registration).
   - **JPA/Hibernate** for database interaction (use an in-memory database like H2 for rapid development).
   
- **Frontend**:
   - **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** or **React** (if you have time) to implement the user interface.
   
- **Database**:
   - Use **H2** (in-memory database) for quick setup and testing, or if time allows, deploy **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL**.

- **Deployment**:
   - **Backend**: Deploy on **Heroku** or **Render**.
   - **Frontend**: Deploy on **Netlify** or **Vercel**.

#### **4. Task Breakdown for Your Team**

- **Backend Developer**:
   - Set up **Spring Boot** and configure the necessary dependencies (Spring Web, JPA, Spring Security).
   - Design **User**, **QuizResult**, and **CareerRecommendation** models.
   - Implement APIs: 
     - `POST /register` (to register users)
     - `POST /login` (to authenticate users)
     - `POST /quiz` (to submit quiz answers)
     - `GET /recommendation` (to fetch career recommendations)
     - `GET /admin/users` (for admin to view users and their results).

- **Frontend Developers**:
   - Build a simple UI for **Home**, **About**, **Login**, **Registration**, **Quiz**, **Result**, and **Admin** pages.
   - Ensure the **Login** and **Registration** forms are functional and connect to the backend APIs.
   - Implement the **Quiz Page** with questions and answers, and submit the data to the backend.
   - Create the **Result Page** to display career recommendations.
   - Make sure the **Admin Page** lists users and their quiz results.

- **Database Developer**:
   - Design the database schema (tables for **Users**, **QuizResults**, **Careers**).
   - Set up a database (use H2 for rapid prototyping).
   - Ensure data is being correctly saved and retrieved.

- **Testing**:
   - Ensure that the registration, login, quiz, and result flow works.
   - Test all API endpoints using tools like **Postman**.
   - Check if the frontend communicates with the backend properly.

### **5. Final Notes**

- **Simplify the Admin Dashboard**: The admin dashboard doesn't need advanced functionality. It should simply show user data and their quiz results.
- **Focus on Essential Functionality**: Do not worry about advanced features or complex design. Your goal is to get the system functional in the shortest time possible.
